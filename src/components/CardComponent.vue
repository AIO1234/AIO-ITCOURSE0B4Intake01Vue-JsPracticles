                Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder
                Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often brightly coloured
                wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous,
                fluttering flight. The group comprises the superfamilies
                Hedyloidea and Papilionoidea.
